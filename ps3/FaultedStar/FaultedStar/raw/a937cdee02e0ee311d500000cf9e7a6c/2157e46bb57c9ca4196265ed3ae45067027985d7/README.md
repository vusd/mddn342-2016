I can call it a gradent genorator now! closed and simple but kinda neat

it now generates tea and what to drink it out of 
very silly

I relised that this is a pun. Because tea cup generation is another name for gen Y/ millenials.

So in a way this is reclaming the word/ hashtag by making very pintrist worthy cups of tea
