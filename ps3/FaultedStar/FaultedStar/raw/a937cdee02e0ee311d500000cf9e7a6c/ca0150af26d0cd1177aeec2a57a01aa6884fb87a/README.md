My bot is a pun, but is also reclaiming the #teacupgeneration. The tea cup generation is another phrase for Gen Y, a group often looked down upon. This Bot generates really pertences cups of tea with a fancy sounding background served out of a gemstone cup. The kind of thing you would find on pinterest. I generates teacups and floods twitter with meaningless data for the hashtag. 

The external data I am using is IMDB’s api. I have put in the production companies of indie films to be recommended with your cup of tea. If the sentence becomes too long for twitter, the movie is cut off the end.

This idea does have room for growth, but that would involve getting more API’s involved. 

My Bot does not generate a very wide variety of artifacts, in fact it's rather predictable. I like this personally because I think the image is always visually appealing even though it's very similar. The text also always follows the same format, but the subtle differences are what make it appealing to me. While each generation is not a unique work of art, I think it works well on twitter as it is recognisable. There is a set structure, but it is variable.  
What I think would make the artifact bad is if it were too random, to the point of not making sense as a collection. This would be a breakdown of structure. Because my bot is so structured there is very little room for bad artifacts, but in a way this makes my bot more boring. 

 I very much enjoy the idea of making twitter bots and I think I will make more in the future, working more closely with interesting forms of external data as my experiments in this bot have been very “safe”.
