Part 2: What are you making?

My generator is a micro art commentery bot, as due to the constraints of the twitter canvas setup I only have a limited canvas space to work on.
I saw this as a design direction, where I use the downscaled proportions as a design aesthetic.

The artefact of my generator is essentially a small robot taking a 100x100 pixel cropout of a piece of art/image and add some commentery that either resolve into positive or negative comments.
The constraints of my bot is that there is still a limited commentery it could make, and also that the scene could quickly become quite repetitive.
The solutions are to be able to rearrange the scene more dynamically in relationship to each other components and perhaps changing up the colour scheme.
