Part 3: Add external data

With my final bot output I have successfully implemented the pixel selector that samples a 150px x 150px portion of an image from an online source (http://loremflickr.com/1080/720/art) The constraint of my previous iteration did become less of a constraint, as I was able to provide an fresh image for the matter of discussion each time I refreshed.

I however still have the constraints for my closed data sources, but this became lesser important as the talking point of my bot is always generating a new image/perspective, resulting my close data to be able to transform its dicussion in other context. 

I also implemented randomness in the display of my scene. the background colour is randomly picked from the colour spectrum and provides a ever changing environment where the centric event is undergoing. This provokes different emotive reponses based on the mood that these colour generates.

The interesting part of my bot is that they don't actually exhibit any signs of emotion, however chooses between the 2 distinctive opposing emotion as a response to the context. I have specifically chosen only positive and negative reponses to narrow down the potential outputs of the bot, but didn't limit the potential of its ability to generate question.
