Part 1: Initial ideas

In the initial ideas stage I've changed the background image and output text to match the correct background.
The background images are images that I digitally painted to represent the four seasons, and the bot responds by outputting a text that provides a response to that particular season.
I'm just experimenting with the idea of season and how people have different opinion of different seasons. I wonder if using a bot to select from a pool of positive and negative responses can generate some discussion in terms of the seasons.

In terms of graphics and taking this idea further, I would like to adopt my own character within this scene, and see if I can provide a stronger talking point for the bot to generate. something that is provocative enough to start a discussion cycle based on its circumstances.
