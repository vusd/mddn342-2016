Click Bait Title Generator

what are you making?

My Initial Idea was to make a bot that generated a quote from a significant person in history and swap out words from the quote to make it funny. But i ended up changing my idea into a clickbait title generator. there is nothing that annoys me more than links with a title that tells you nothing. My clickbait title is focused on ones that list the top # of some kind of joke. 

external data

I wanted to have the bot use the object that is passed from a closed library and pull the most relevant article on the topic with API from the guardian. unfourtunately I was unable to get this working. 

proposed extention

I would like to first of all get links posting to a related article depending on the object. I would also like to explore pulling images from that particular thing so that the text actually has a relevance to the image. at this stage my bot still feels unfinished.
