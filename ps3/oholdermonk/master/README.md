PS3 MDDN 342 2016

For my project I wanted to join the ideas of constant surveillance with the emotion of loneliness. It is a bizarre paradigm that this generation is the most surveilled/connected group in history, yet also one with an immensely large population identifying as being/have been depressed. I felt the reinforcement of these depressing statistics/statements with empty public spaces causes a strange connection between the elements.
My artifacts had to relate to each other, one being a statement/feeling, the other being a visual representation of this.

My choice of using roads came about as they are such enormous feats of civilisation and used by such a large number of people. But when you just look at a road through a security camera it just feels empty of life (regardless of whether there are cars there or not), you almost feel as though you are just the camera itself looking at all the people going past.

I produced a couple of sentences with tracery that would emote this emptiness, making sure to include the enormity of these feelings.
