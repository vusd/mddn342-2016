Where's Will Final: Find Will Smith from within the collage of people.

Changes: I've added a 90's inspired background to add a bit more depth and character to the bot. PNG's are now scaled to allow for images that are more feasible. There are the odd occassions where Will's face is massive, but I think that adds humour to the bot.

My generated artifact is a collage of PNG's, with Will Smith's face hiding in between the layers, much like "Where's Wally". Good concrete properties for the outcomes include overlapping PNGs, and Will Smith's face being obscured mostly. This makes a more challenging experience for the user, and a greater sense of accomplishment once they find Will. This is accomplished by sizing the PNG's to an appropriate size. Variation is created by distributing the PNG's randomly on the canvas to ensure that most images generated provide a challenge.

Adding the green source of PNG's (via the Tumblr API) made me consider the scaling of the images more specifically, as the images received are of varying dimensions. Along with this, the amount of images received is variable, depending on the blog accessed. These factors affected the scaling and distribution of the PNG's within my bot's post.
