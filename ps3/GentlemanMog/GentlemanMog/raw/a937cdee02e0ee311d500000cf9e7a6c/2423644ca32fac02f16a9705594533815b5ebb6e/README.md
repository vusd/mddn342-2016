This is initial stages of the OPEN bot, here the idea is to recieve two images from the online database, in this case its pokemon, and create some sort of glitch art out of them, then create a short summery using thier data entries mixed with tracery words. My original plan was to recieve two pokemon based on live twitch users that are curently chatting away on a popular streamers chat, using thier username to formulate which pokemon they most likly resemble (aka the first valid letter of thier username matches the first letter of the pokemons name chosen at random)

Problems with my original plan was that I was unable to access the twitch user chatter api and have adapted to see fit. At the moment the bot chooses a random number between 1 and 720.
