This is the third step of my idea. My idea is to create marble images and use colours from photos I get from an online API to re-colour the marble.

Right now, it picks a random image from a closed set of images. It generates a colour palette using the image. It then takes a sample from a large marble image. Then the colour palette is applied to the image. The dominant colour is tracked and is compared to the list of Crayola colours, finding the closest match. The message is made of the name of the closest matching Crayola colour and a name to describe the image.

The next step is to get the image used for the colour palette from an API.
