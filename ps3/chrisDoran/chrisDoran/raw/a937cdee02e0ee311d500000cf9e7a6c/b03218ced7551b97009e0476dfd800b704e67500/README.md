Part 2
I used my bot as a way of making a point about consumer culture. It takes religious quotes and replaces all mention of religious figures such as ‘God’ or ‘The Lord’ with one of a large selection of modern corporate brands. It presents the information in the form of an inspirational quote or prayer with an image taken from flickr with the search parameter of “Christ” to allow for fairly consistent religious imagery. 
To me, a good or successful article is one that seems like any other inspirational image with quoted text on top of it. The difference being of course that the brand names have been added. I would like the results to be subtle and require people to think about the message that the bot is trying to make, so a level of abstraction is almost desired. I would like people to have to discover the fact that these are religious quotes that have been altered. To me that combination of subtlety and abstraction will lead to the satire each article is aiming for. 

What will make this an unsuccessful bot would be if the bot puts out a result that doesn’t quite gel together such as if the phrasing of the quote does not match that of the brand being put in the place. Another important detail is the background image, while the flickr randomised imaged based on the phrase ‘Christ’ is fairly consistent, it could potentially have unfortunate results. The white text must also be legible over all images, rather than disappearing among some images. 

The biggest challenge here is the image; I have little control over the image passed my search term. However, I have added a background area to the quote to aid its aesthetic and make it legible at all times. I have added code that tests for the different forms that ‘God’ and ‘The Lord’ appear that choose the correct and most sensible place to replace with a brand. 
I have also tried communicating with twitter to get a good source of these religious inspirational quotes to use, that way the bot will have a level of unpredictability, allowing the results to always differ, using a particular twitter account to take from, that way the tweets remain on message. This combined with the large list of brands I created will lead to very variant results. However getting this to work within the bot framework was/is incredibly difficult. 
The alternative is simply to load the bot up with a heap of different quotes. Which is undesirable. 

Part 3
Adding the external inputs was tough. Flickr’s images suffered due to the randomness, they do sometimes just not apply to the quotes, however this is rare. 
Dealing with twitter was also tough, but it was worth it when the tweets became more and more surprising to me. For the trade off with the possibly bad images, the external data was easily worth the trouble. It lead to a more varied and successful bot. The changing data also challenged the background for the text. As it did not always fit correctly. However, again this was infrequently. 

Overall taking images from an image sharing site with the tag of ‘Christ’ and using real existing religious material aiding my parody of consumer culture.
