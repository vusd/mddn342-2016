## Twitter Bot

The bot produces text and images based off the latest news headlines from a variety of sources. The text templates are quotes from the popular movie shrek. while the image template are snapshots of the same movie that is related to the quote. The message is the quote with a word or phrase from the news headline inserted into it and the image will be the snapshot of the movie with the image from the news headline overlaid onto it.

The news data is requested from an external source. The news API I'm using collates data from different news sources, allowing you to pick the source and provides the data in a consistent format.

For now the movie quotes and images will be provided in a closed manner (I have selected memorable quotes from the children's movie Shrek, also popular in recent internet culture). A possible extension of this bot would be to randomly select movie quotes and images from an external source along with the news data.
