This generator will create 'glitch art', in which images fed into the the bot willbe subjected to a pixel sorting algorithm and then displayed.

Good pixel sorted images depends largely on the image being sorted and the algorithm sorting it. There are definately sorted images that look better than other sorted images, but it can take some degree of effort to come up with a sorted image that looks
entirely awful. 

Final iteration. Due to a security issue it seems impossible to create a green bot that can scrape images from other hosts.

Before completing this assingment I assumed that it would be hard to create bad pixelsorted art, no matter what the image, thinking an image would have to be all one colour or something similar to achieve such a feat. However I can see now that it is certainly possible to have such a dichotmy between outputs that there are many images that pale in comparison to others. 

I have found that the best images are usually ones with high constrast, with more darkness than lightness. This is mostly due to the algorithm with which I sort the pixels, however high contrasting images are still a good rule a thumb with most if not all pixelsorting algorithms.
