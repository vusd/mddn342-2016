Current objective is a "fake science" bot which comes up with catchy clickbait-style
headlines.

I have a basic grammar which I will integrate with a news site and api such as wordnik.

I have attempted to use multiple sentence analysis APIs to extract elements from
news titles however none that I tried provided consistent results.
