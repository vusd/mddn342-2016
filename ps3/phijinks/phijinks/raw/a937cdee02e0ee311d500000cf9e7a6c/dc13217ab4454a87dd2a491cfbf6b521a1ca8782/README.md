PS3 MDDN 342 2016

For PS3 I decided to make a bot which generates an album (with an artist, and a list of tracks).
It uses Tracery to make a (hopefully) somewhat believable band/singer name, an album name, and then some number of track names.

Still to do:
- use flickr to find a photo to use as album art
- figure out a way to draw the text (album/artist name) on the photo in the best place to put text
