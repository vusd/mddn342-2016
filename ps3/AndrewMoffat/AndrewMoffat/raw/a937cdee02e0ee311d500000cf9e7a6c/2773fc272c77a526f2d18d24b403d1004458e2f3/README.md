An example of how to get started with the Online Chatbot.

Do not modify the skech.js: all changes should be made to bot.js.

Began by clearing out most of the code, and restarting from scratch. Working with the bot, I wanted to create a city generator, that would create a city and a name for it as well. I wanted each city to have distinct roads, and the same sort of grid system we see normally in a city. I wanted to work towards a very bold graphic style, utilising color. This first experiment was a good starting point, but I disliked the city pattern, and wanted to redo that bit. liked the roads though.
