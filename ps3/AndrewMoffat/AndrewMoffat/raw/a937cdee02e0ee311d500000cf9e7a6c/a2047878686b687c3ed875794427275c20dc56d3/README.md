An example of how to get started with the Online Chatbot.

Do not modify the skech.js: all changes should be made to bot.js.

I wanted each city to have distinct roads, and the same sort of grid system we see normally in a city. I wanted to work towards a very bold graphic style, utilising color. This first experiment was a good starting point, but I disliked the city pattern, and wanted to redo that bit. liked the roads though.

Unfortunately I could not get this code working. Its intent was to take a city in real life, and take the wind speed from that city, and use the wind speed to determine the straightness of the streets.


My generator creates new cities, making their form, main thorughfares, as well as naming the city itself. It does this from a map perspective, and uses a map style colour scheme. I really do wish I could have got the API to work, and moving on from that taking and adjusting the color of the city base from the weather of the city I am pulling data from.

I wanted each city to have its unique shape and roads, and name, however I did not want any of the cities to be very boxlike, or to have roads that formed a gridlike 90 degree angle pattern.
