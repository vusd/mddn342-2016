PS3 MDDN 342 2016 - Obamabot Closed to Open Iteration - 2

An Obamabot that uses some internal images of current US president Obama using string based data from the News API - which is a large JSON api endpoint,
to manipulate images and text on the twitterbot.

Development: Looking at the data I can pull from the News API, I can grab images relating to the articles, headline text, article description,
and even names of authors. However this can only be sorted by either top news, popular news or latest news.
Here I will have to be a little tricky with how I want to grab and process data streams. 
I have sorted the data between the categories of title, description and image url (for the article).
I am looking at pulling some text from the title and description to make in to some sentence. 
I also have to place some form of accreditation for using the News API data sets. 
The material taken from the API is quite limited in that it only
sorts by top, popular or latest at any given time - and not all news headlines. 
I have parsed the data into my bot and am now in the process of sorting it into something meaningful - as a concept and final solution.

Final Note: For some reason my parsing of the data has not gone as planned. The twitterbot is still a closed bot with data 
available but not usable at the moment.
Will need to further refine this idea to make it usable in the future - perhaps as my final presentation?
