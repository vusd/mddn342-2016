PS3 MDDN 342 2016

Here I have configured the food and shelters to jump to the character if hes within 50 pixels. When the character is in shelter or consuming food / heart the zombies are not able to attack him which finally introduces some parameters for survival. 

-I want the spawn rate of zombies to increase as it gets darker.

-I want to implement weather or tweet API.

-I need to re visit the paragraph that is generated to better suit the characters situation in the maze.
