PS3 MDDN 342 2016

I have developed the character and given them a health bar interface. I also want to add food and water as variables to their overall endurance in the maze.

from here:
I plan on developing potential attaks and traps the character could potentially fall into,
I want to add food and  water resources the character can stumble upon.
I want to use the weather API to simulate real world tempratures and conditions in the maze as well as real time day and night schedules.
