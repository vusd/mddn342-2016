Online Chatbot - Boom Creeper

I created a chatbot where I get the number of players online on minecraft's api data and use that to sketch the same amount of Creepers from the very same game. It tells you how much creepers that will blow you up. 

It has different colour palletes to add variety and it is easier to see the amount visually better unlike the last iteration where all green creepers blends with each other therefore the amount of visual data is inaccurate with the total amount of creepers. 

Scale also changes each sketch so it losses the pattern of the creepers one size and since the creepers represent the players online, it gives the idea of showing a visual presentation of age and body size which varies between people.

Each creeper face are made using multiple squares with different tones to show the pixelated art of the creature. Each square have the same size for an accurate square face.

Part 2:	What are you making?	
Artifact
I want to generate an artifact of sketching a creature that is sketched according to the number of users online in a api therefore it changes values from time to time and add variety.The quality I want to make is to create a scenario of "Danger" and "Safe" where if the amount of players online are many, it will create a hazardous amount of creatures to attack on the screen while the amount of players dwindle will have a controllable amount of creatures.

Bad Artifact(Constraints)
-The amount of sketched creatures must be within the sketch so it can properly give an accurate visual amount with the actual amount in the data. 
-The amount of players may vary a lot in a real-time data.

Solution 
-The creature in the sketch changes colors to add variety and it gives an accurate visual amount information.
-The amount of players is restricted to not go higher than max players online.
-Creepers is restricted to be drawn inside the sketch with enough random value to spread across.

Part 3:	Add	external data
Since the data being used changes overtime and it's a large value, I needed to sketch in random areas of the sketch instead of creating a it in a pattern.
