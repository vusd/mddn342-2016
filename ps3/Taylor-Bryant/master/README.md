So in my final version i added the new source of images to draw from as this help me in conrtolling the amount of bad artifacts to a degree while also fitting the way i want the images to come out.

--------------

My bot is a simple digital representation of an old bond villan or evil genius that is trying to take over the world. The goal was and is to provide a number of images that are presented togeather in a way that presents them as the building blocks for a new evil plan for world domination. 

The bot started out as a simple here are some images that can be presented randomly from a local source to make a plan from, the contents of the images isnt really a large issue as that is part of the idea for a world domination planning bot, its going to go though hundreds of plans and they are going to be as wacky and as silly as they can be. How ever i started to come across an issue where i would often get duplicates of images many times in a single plan. A good outcome from this bot would have all different images being presented so that there was no overlap of 6 images that had a sad donkey even thou that would make for a funny plan it wasnt what the bot was supposed to do in that regard.

In terms of contraints there was only a select number of thigns i could do without making so that it only got images of a select subject matter for each image created which i decided isnt what i want to do for the bot aswell as i could no at the time since it was a closed bot. So I decided that limiting the number of images would help to reduce the chances of duplictate ones being able to appear and settled on 4 images though the thinking that 4 limited the selection enought to reduce the risk of duplicates and also offers enought variate to present some interesting plans.

After going green though using an image placeholder website to draw my images from i found that the larger selection of images to draw from was a big help in reducing the chance for having three of the same image appearing in one plan form the bot. Looking back i still kept the 4 image limit on the bot due to it allowing largwer images to be on the screen and due to it still helping reducing any chance of duplicate images happening. Infact after seeing it on the twitter stream the contraint i added took on more than one reason being the sizing issue i would have with more than 4 images.

Lastly while i was finishing the bot i was looking at it and relised that the bot could go one step more and while it presented the building blocks still towards world domination though funny and random images i wanted to know what plans people were thinking the bot had come up with using that, i then decided that the bot should be asking people to retweet their own plans that they had come up with using the building blocks. So the bot was less of a every so often here are some subjects that im going to use to take over the world to here is the ideas for a new plan to take over the world, how do you think this can work? or HELP ME TAKE OVER THE WORLD MWAHAHAHA. This would add a level of interactivity even if the bot never replied.

Do not modify the skech.js: all changes should be made to bot.js.
