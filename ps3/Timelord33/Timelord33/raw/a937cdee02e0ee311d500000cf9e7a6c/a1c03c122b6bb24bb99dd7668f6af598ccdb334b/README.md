# The Little Twitter-Bot of Calm

A twitter-bot that creates inspirational quotes and photo collages to calm you on a stressful day. 

My initial experiment was to make an insult generator that simply grabbed synonyms from an online dictionary and inserted them into a "Shakesperian insult" like phrase (thou art a...). 

The generator is a humerous version of the Little Book of Calm by Paul Wilson as used in Black Books. One of those books that gives you suggestions on ways to make yourself feel calm when stressed. A satirical look at self-help. This includes a phrase and an image composed of a collage of "soothing" photos, grabbbed randomly off the internet in order to make it a green bot. 

An example of a good artifact of this bot would have a phrase that makes grammatical sense but is semantically rediculous, and an image composed of photos of water, forests and birds etcetera. A bad artifact might pull up words that dont make grammatical sense like if I pull up synonyms that are a verb rather than a noun but are still synonymous. 

External API's were used: the Wordnik API for the text, however it's the Pixabay API that makes this a green bot as it pulls image results from a search that will include new images as users upload them.
