## Part 1:
My initial experiment was to make an insult generator that simply grabbed synonyms from an online dictionary and inserted them into a "Shakesperian insult" like phrase (thou art a...). 

## Part 2:
I want the generator to be a humerous version of the Little Book of Calm. One of those books that gives you suggestions on ways to make yourself feel calm when stressed. A satirical look at self-help. This would include a phrase and an image composed of a collage "soothing" photos, proberbly grabbbed randomly off the internet in order to make it a green bot. 

A good artifact would have a phrase that makes grammatical sense but is semantically rediculous, and an image composed of images like water, forests and birds. A bad artifact might pull up words that dont make grammatical sense like if I pull up synonyms that are a verb rather than a noun but are still synonymous. 

## Part 3:
For external data I integrated the Wordnik API for the text, however it's the Pixabay API that makes this a green bot as it pulls image results from a search that will include images as users post them. Adding these hasn't made me question my initial constraints, just that parameters need tweaking.
