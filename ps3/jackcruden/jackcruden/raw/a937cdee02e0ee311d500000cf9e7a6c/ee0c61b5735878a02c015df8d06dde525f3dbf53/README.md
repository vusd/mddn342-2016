PS3 MDDN 342 2016

Part 1: Initial ideas
I have managed to swap out some images and change the response text. Wrapped my head around the methods and where certain code snippets should be placed. I've explored pulling images from Flickr but have not yet managed to get them to load.

Part 2: What are you making?
I am making an inspirational quote generator. It is intended to be humorous and bazaar.
For this generator to be successful the "quotes" it generates will need to be somewhat structured sentences. The images will need to either relevant, or be a typical landscape/sunset image that might typically be used in the background.
Things that could make this bot unsuccessful include irrelevant images being taken from Flickr and nonsensical "quotes".
To ensure that this bot generates successful artefacts I will be pulling images from Flickr using keywords relevant to the "quote". The structure of the quotes will be predetermined but will pull random words from the Wordnik API.

Part 3: Add external data / Final
I have added a bunch more response structures and some of these generated artefacts are hilarious. I really feel like I would like to work further on this Twitter Bot project for our final project, but with different a different idea.
